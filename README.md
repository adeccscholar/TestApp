# TestApp
Repository with the project work during the semester break in February and March 2022

The project was started as a semester break project during a Twitch live broadcast on our Twitch channel 
[adecc Scholar](https://www.twitch.tv/volker_adecc) channel on 21.02.2022 and then further developed 
step by step over next 1.5 months.  The videos are now available on our Youtube channel 
["adecc Systemhaus GmbH"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFviXIMSxXt_789Kb_SLqAA) and can be found in 
the playlist ["Semesterpausenprojekt 1"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3kb_jqZh5ZtaluOHhOz_8DaMociGpaRe). 

# Modern C++ live, a problem "build from scratch" with modern C++

I was thinking if you can somehow connect all the requirements and work them out on a concrete problem. 
And how to get this into the semester free time. Since most of the people already have to do with C++, 
and for all the others I can get a motivation for the next semester, I decided against the more complex 
C example, and chose C++.

Of course it should be about modern C++, be as independent as possible, and be explained and developed step by step. Often new features of standards are presented, but the connection to the concrete usage is missing. Therefore I would like to look for another way and begin with a concrete problem, in order to deal then step by step with standard C++ and modern C++, explain the characteristics, and use then with the concrete problem.

At least two different IDEs will be used live. We will start with C++Builder and VCL and then move on to 
Visual Studio and Qt. For both sides it is interesting to see the other possibilities and to learn how to 
become more independent.

In doing so, I have set the following guidelines:
- Start from 21. February 2022, Mo / Mi / Fr in each case starting from 20:00 clock
- from problem / concrete task to solution
- simple task, focus on the solution, not the task (reduction of complexity to a necessary level)
- simple interface
- "build from scratch
- process models, design / implementation / test (test data)
- iterative, from problem / task to initial implementation and later generalization
- modular and extensible

there is a separate discussion area on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/E8tzbu2FTY)
- step-by-step approach and detailed explanations, if necessary
- publicly accessible only via Twitch live + VOD (max. 14 days)
- no provided sources, everything happens in the video 
- open discussion (chat, mailing, Discord), questions, ideas
