Repository with the project work during the semester break in February and March 2022

Modern C++ live, a problem "build from scratch" with modern C++.

I was thinking if it is possible to connect all requirements somehow and work on a concrete problem. And how to get this into the semester free time. Since most of the people already have to do with C++, and for all the others I can get a motivation for the next semester, I decided against the more complex C example, and chose C++.

Of course it should be about modern C++, be as independent as possible, and be explained and developed step by step. Often new features of standards are presented, but the connection to the concrete usage is missing. Therefore I want to look for another way and start with a concrete problem, and then step by step go into standard C++ and modern C++, explain the properties, and then use them with the concrete problem.

At least two different IDEs will be used live. We will start with C++Builder and VCL and then move on to Visual Studio and Qt. For both sides it is interesting to see the other possibilities and to learn how to become more independent.

In doing so, I have set the following guidelines:
- Start from 21. February 2022, Mo / Mi / Fr in each case starting from 20:00 clock
- from problem / concrete task to solution
- simple task, focus on the solution, not the task (reduction of complexity to a necessary level)
- simple interface
- "build from scratch
- process models, design / implementation / test (test data)
- iterative, from problem / task to initial implementation and later generalization
- modular and extensible
- step-by-step approach and detailed explanations, if necessary
- publicly available only via Twitch live + VOD (max. 14 days)
- no provided sources, everything happens in the video 
- open discussion (chat, mailing, Discord), questions, ideas
- use of C++11, C++14, C++17 (C++Builder restricts it)
- use of regular expressions, standard containers
- limited use of free libraries like boost and pugiXML
